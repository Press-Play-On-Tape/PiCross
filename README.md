# Game Mechanics
You need to fight your way in the dark castle of the evil AstaroK, by casting runes that will allow access of different powers depending on the result symbols on the casted runes. You start with a limited arsenal of Skills but will be able to acquired more advanced skills with the SP (Skill Points) that you will gain by winning battles in the dark castle.

Skills can be learned by spending SP when you are back to town after you lose a fight or choose to go back to town after winning a fight in the castle. Be careful, if you are defeated in the castle, you will be warp back to town but with half of the SP that you gained during that run.

Also available in town will be a training ground where you can test your newly acquired skills and learn how to best use them.
